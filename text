As a developer, I want to build an ecommerce website. It needs to have following core functionalities:
• Registration Module.
• Login through username and password with authentication using an OTP.
• Change Password.
• Forgot Password.
• Product Catalog with amount, images, description.
• Add to Cart.

Please suggest a high level design to implement this website.
